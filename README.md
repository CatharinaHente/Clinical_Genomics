Clinical Genomics - AI Powered Early Stage Cancer Screening

Team: Catharina Hente, Polina Ivanova

Mentor: Arvid Gollwitzer

Duration: 14 weeks


Problem: Cancer is among leading causes of death worldwide, with colorectal cancer being one of the most frequently occuring types. Early stage
          diagnosis often key to preventing disease from spreading - new technology such as AI should be implemented to aid medical professionals in
          diagnosis as well as selection of patients prone to disease for more vigorous screenings 
          
Goal: implement and train an efficient machine learning algorithm to predict a patient having CRC based on the patient's gut microbiome data
