Overall notes:

Steps (from presentation): 
1. Sequencing Data Generation
2. Basecalling/Denoising
3. Read Mapping - the process of aligning short DNA sequences (reads) from a sample to a reference genome to determine their origin. 
   It works by comparing the reads to a known database, accounting for possible mismatches or errors
4. Downstream Analysis - refers to the steps taken after raw genomic data has been processed. It involves tasks like identifying 
   genetic variants, analyzing gene expression, classifying species in a sample, or linking genes to biological functions. 

Confounders - variables that affect both the independent variable (what you're studying) and the dependent variable (the outcome), 
               potentially leading to misleading results.

4.Downstream Analysis: 
   *Alpha diversity - diversity within a specific area or ecosystem, focusing on the number of species (richness) and their 
                     relative abundances.
                     -> Shannon index - measures biodiversity by quantifying the uncertainty in predicting the species of a randomly selected individual, 
                        considering both the number of species and their relative abundances
   *Beta diversity - the differences in species composition between different ecosystems or habitats, reflects how species diversity 
                     changes from one environment to another.
                     -> Bray-Curtis distance - measures compositional dissimilarity between two samples based on species abundance 
                        (ranges 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different))

      StrainPhlAn3 -  tool identifies and analyzes microbial strains from metagenomic data, integrating read mapping and variant calling
      inStrain - tool for analyzing and characterizing microbial genomes, particularly focusing on strain-level variations within metagenomic 
               datasets, (Strain reconstruction - variant detection - community analysis)
   ML Approach:
      LASSO  - regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance the prediction accuracy and 
            interpretability of statistical models
      AUROC -  performance measurement for classification models, particularly in binary classification tasks, quantifies the ability of a 
            model to discriminate between positive and negative classes.

   Validation:
      Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test - non-parametric statistical test used to compare the distributions of two independent samples, alternative to
                     t-test when the data do not meet the assumptions of normality
      Benjamini-Hochberg procedure - statistical method used to control the false discovery rate (FDR) when performing multiple hypothesis tests.
